This document is a description of how to expand the functionality of gcov metrics. Currently, gcov only covers the entire project.
To get per-file coverage, you need to get gcovr. gcovr produces an XML output file, which can be loaded into the database using the LOAD XML command, similar to cppcheck. 
The database would need a new table, similar to the cpp check table. The LOAD XML command can be called int he hook or from Jenkins. 
The new table would have the columns gcov_metrics_ID, file_ID, commit_ID. Then, there would be columns for any of the metrics that you would like to store. 
file_ID and commit_ID would be foreign keys from the File table and the Commit_info table respectively.
Additionally, you should remove the "percent_coverage" field from the Commit_info table because this data will now be redundant.
